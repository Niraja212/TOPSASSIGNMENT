<!-- 3.JavaScript Operators
Lab Assignment-3: o Create a JavaScript program to perform the following:  Add, subtract, multiply, 
and divide two numbers using arithmetic operators. 
 Use comparison operators to check if two numbers are equal and if one number is greater than the other. 
 Use logical operators to check if both conditions (e.g., a > 10 and b < 5) are true.-->
